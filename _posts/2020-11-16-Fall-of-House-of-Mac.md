When I was young, I remember my grandmother quietly smirking to herself while looking at a newspaper.

What a great distillation of Apple Computers: It's pretty. But it's wrong.

# Hey, what's going on?

15 Years ago Apple moved away from the `PowerPC` chips they had used since 1994 and joined the rest of the computational world under the `x86` umbrella. Once again, Apple is changing CPU types, this time from `x86` to `ARM` based CPUs. Instead of limiting the `ARM` CPUs to their iPad/iPhones, they're removing the `x86` chips from the Macbook Pro all together and aggresively replacing them with a newly developed variant of the CPU they use in their iOS devices.

The numbers Apple is claiming seem to be impressive performance out of an ARM Chip. Most user's workloads will be unaffected by this as the world continues to move towards an `IOT` Connected World.

_However..._

Even _if_ the claims of performance gains are true -- A change this big will have ramifications that will be felt for quite some time.

Apple _says_ that any side effects of this imprompteu head transplant will be remedied by none other than it's own compatibility solution.

If there's _one_ name I trust for a proven record of reliable hardware and software _it's absolutely not Apple._

# Benevolent Dictatorship

The new CPU is the final piece in the puzzle for Apple's Authoritarian Control over their Walled Garden.

They now make every single piece of the Hardware _and_ the Software. Apple finally controls the entire flow `Code Execution` _more_ than they ever have.

> Apple Computers _will always_ obey Apple, before they obey _any_ other instruction.

While there's a meme-worthy list of public controversies that point to absolute mallice, why would they ever want to change?

In August 2018, Apple became the first US Company to be evaluated at `$1 Billion`. Just _2 years_ later, they were the first company to be evaluated at `$2 Billion`.

If you need a quick refresher, here's[^1] a mix tape I put together of some of their finest work.

So if that's how Apple treats it's ~~Serfs~~ _Customers_ ...

# Banality of Evil

Every interaction from Apple should be treated as sleight of hand. One hand spins the tale of Privacy, while the other sends buckets of user information to the NSA as part of the [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.#Collaboration_with_the_National_Security_Agency) spying program.

In the first half of 2019 they did this over 18,000 times, and another [17,500+ times in the second half of 2019.](https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/)

The dangers of Centralization were shown in full force when Macbooks across the globe were _unwilling_ to execute 3rd party applications due to an Apple Server Outage.

This server outage meant that MacOS couldn't "Phone Home" for to Apple, and then stopped the flow of execution. Obviously it's more complicated, but the facts still stand. Code Execution _stopped_ when apps tried, and failed to reach an Apple Server. This turns your `~$3,000` laptop into a `~$3,000` statement piece.

MacOS Big Sur and Apple's M1 Chip _finally_ remove the thin and tattered veil of alturism.

While _EVERY_ Consumer Electronics Company has a hand in the never-ending human rights violations of the PRC, Apple is in a unique position to make meaningful change.

Every red cent of profit Apple makes while continuing to ignore China's Human Rights Violations...sadly means _nothing_ to them. I wish I had a more impactful statement.

The fight for Hong Kong was a major fight for the Free World. And when we needed Apple the most, they revealed themselves to be spineless lapdogs bowing to Authoritarianism by censoring Apps on behalf of Xi Jiin Ping.

Controling the supply chain domestically would make mid-range hardware from 2014 cost $2,000. Even though I'm personally very excited to [dive into this exact kind](https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5-usa/) of thing.


# "I'm sad. I hate this."

Same.

Trying to convince Apple Cultists to stop denying their experiences is a _fruitless_ effort.

All I can do with the time I have is work tirelessly to make things better for people I love.

Nobody said the good fight would be easy. Look out for the ones who are looking out for you.
