# Hey, what's going on?

15 Years ago Apple moved away from the `PowerPC` chips they had used since 1994 and joined the rest of the computational world under the `x86` umbrella. In 2020, Apple is changing CPU types again, this time from `x86` to `ARM` based CPUs.

To summarize the difference between `x86` and `ARM` architecture: `x86` is a Cross Country runner, built for sustained torture tests. `ARM` CPUs are Sprinters that thrive under short bursty workloads.

Apple is teasing some impressive numbers. _Most users_ in the Apple Ecosystem will only benefit from this change.

_However..._

Even if the performance gains are true -- A change this big will have ramifications that will be felt for quite some time.

I'm suspicious of it's performance over long durations like Code Compilation and Media Rendering.

Apple says that any side effects of this brain transplant will be remedied by none other than Apple.

If there's _one_ name I trust for a proven record of reliable hardware and software _it's not Apple._

# Benevolent Dictatorship

The new CPU is the final piece in the puzzle for Apple's Authoritarian Control over their Walled Garden.

They now make every single piece of the Hardware _and_ the Software. Apple finally controls the entire flow `Code Execution` from toe-to-tip.

> Apple Computers _will always_ obey Apple Inc before obeying _any_ other instruction.

In August 2018, Apple became the first US Company to be evaluated at `$1 Trillion`. Two years later, they were the first company to be evaluated at `$2 Trillion`.

A quick look back at some public controversies[^1] shows absolute mallice...But why would they ever want to change?

And if that's how Apple treats it's ~~Serfs~~ _Customers_ ...

# Big Sur...veillance

Every interaction from Apple should be treated as sleight of hand. One hand spins the tale of a Privacy Champion, the other sends user information to the NSA whole sale as part of the [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.#Collaboration_with_the_National_Security_Agency) spying program.

In the first half of 2019 they did this over 18,000 times, and another [17,500+ times in the second half of 2019.](https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/)

The dangers of Centralized Services became woefully apparent on `11-12-20` as [Apple Servers became _slow_ to respond](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21563092/apple-mac-apps-load-slow-big-sur-downloads-outage-down-issues) to network traffic. Because of this, Macbooks across the globe were unable to launch 3rd party Applications.

This turned your `~$3,000` laptop into a `~$3,000` statement piece.

Turns out, Apple sends a _healthy_ amount of telemetry back to it's own servers. Apple claims 3rd party Apps phoning home before being given permission to launch is in the interest of User's _Security._ 🔐

I'm glad Apple has been _transparent_ about the information they're collecting.

Apple is being _so transparent,_ that they're not even encrypting this telemetry. They're sending it plain text out of your macbook, across the internet to the nearest CDN so that _everyone_ between you and the server can see what apps you're using by opening `wireshark` or `tcpdump`.

I speculate that Apple's mad dash to seal the doors to their ecosystem was rapidly accelerated by the latest of their many [public slap fights](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know) with another company.

# The Banality of Evil

While _EVERY_ Consumer Electronics Company has a hand in the staggering human rights violations of the People's Republic of China; Apple is in a unique position to make meaningful changes.

But during the fight for Hong Kong, when we needed Apple the most they revealed themselves as spineless lapdogs. Tim Cook bowed to Authoritarianism by censoring Apps at the request of ~~Xi Jinping~~ [Pooh Bear](../../../assets/images/Misc/oh_bother.jpg).

Controlling the supply chain domestically makes mid-range hardware from 2014 cost $2,000. While I'm personally very excited to [dive into this exact kind](https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5-usa/) of thing, it's basically like taking food _right out of Tim Cook's mouth._

# This sucks, now I'm sad.

Yeah. I'm not a lot of fun at parties. 😕

I'm just old and grumpy. This kind of stuff was never going to affect me, because I don't use computers in a way that's made me need Apple.

Besides, I'm a fan of Software Freedom, not Software Do-It-My-Way-or-Fuck-You.

Trying to convince someone to uproot their entire digital-self and migrate is kinda..._fruitless_.

I'll end by sharing a warm childhood memory.

Thanks for suffering through my mind-sludge while you're stuck on the toilet or something.

When I was young, I remember my grandmother quietly smirking to herself while looking at a newspaper.
