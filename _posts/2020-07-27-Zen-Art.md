# The Zen Art of Hardware Maintenance

While I was finishing cabling my last build, I stopped to reflect on how this reignited a passion that I feared may have been lost.

I was able to do something I've not been able to do in a long time: *I was able to fucking slow down.* I could consider the *best* ways to approach problems. I was able to experiment, measure, and re-evaluate.

I'd forgotten what it was like to _enjoy_ this kind of work. I had started to doubt myself as an engineer. But I found a long-forgotten peace in the small acts of routing cables, cinching zip ties, and tightening screws.

I became lost in a vacuum of muted reflection as I thought about the heat, the airflow, and the connections of it all.

I rediscovered my _mind of metal and wheels_.

It dawned on me how each machine I'd built was a time capsule. How [This Machine](/2020/07/23/This-Machine.html) had been almost 20 years in the making.

Time is the only constant in the known universe. It is unyielding and relentless. It makes fools of us all. Our rotten little human hearts beat at time's `core-clock` speed.

_"So why the fuck am I in such a hurry?"_

I thought back on a _lifetime_ ignoring time to make sure things were done _once_ and were done _right_.

I've received plenty of (genuine) constructive criticism about my work not adhering to a manufactured deadline. During one of these reviews, I was told something that really re-framed how I approach problems:

> "You should have been a watch maker."

Oh shit, wait. ğŸ¤”

Maybe was that just a _really_ passive aggressive burn.

_Damn dude._
