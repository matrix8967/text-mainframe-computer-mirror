## Timewarp

America seems to have dropped any pretense of subtlety in it's pursuits of a _Christian-Taliban Theocratic Oligarchy_.

`Roe V. Wade` was never about fetuses or children - it was about saving women from the unfathomable horrors of self mutilation...

As a way to combating the looming feeling of helplessness -- I've gathered some informational resources to share here.

I hope nobody I love ever has to refer to this information...But there's no virtuie in ingnorance...

So let's get started.

## The worst DIY project

A quick disclaimer: I'm just another dude on the internet.

I don't know fucking _anything_.

_These resources are strictly educational._

It's up to you to understand the various risks involved with your situation.

This is not Medical Advice or Legal Advice.

The following are resources for accessing medication (mifepristone & misoprostol) and managing your health at home.

These are _NOT_ Emergency Contraceptives (PlanB). This is also not a `1:1` substitute for a clinical medical procedure.

So I guess that's that.

I wish I had something meaningful to leave off on...

Typing up shitty blog posts isn't going to fix this...But maybe it'll be good bathroom reading for someone, idfk.

It feels like it's going to get worse before it gets worse...

Feels like we're trapped in the _never ending_ end of the world...

But the only way out is _through_. Gotta keep moving, no matter how many skies keep falling.

glhf. Later.
