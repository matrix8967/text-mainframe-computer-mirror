## Timewarp

America seems to have dropped any pretense of subtlety in it's pursuits of a _Theocratic Oligarchy_.

`Roe V. Wade` was never about fetuses or children - it was about trading in the unfathomable horrors of self mutilation for reasonable access to basic reproductive health care.

As a way to combating the looming feeling of helplessness -- I've gathered some informational resources to share here.

I hope nobody I love ever has to refer to this information...But there's no virtue in ingnorance...

So let's get started.

## _Totally_ legally binding disclaimer:

I'm just another dude on the internet.

I don't know fucking _anything_.

_These resources are strictly for educational purposes._

It's up to you to understand the various risks involved with your situation.

This is not Medical Advice or Legal Advice. It's _questionable_ advice at best?

The following are resources for accessing medication (mifepristone & misoprostol) and managing your reproductive health at home.

These are _NOT_ Emergency Contraceptives (PlanB). This is also not a `1:1` substitute for a clinical medical procedure.

So I guess that's that.

I wish I had something meaningful to leave off on...

Typing up shitty blog posts isn't going rid the world of the _Christian-Taliban_.

But maybe it'll be good bathroom reading for someone, idfk.

It feels like it's going to get worse before it gets worse...

Feels like we're trapped in the _never ending_ end of the world...

But the only way out is _through_. Gotta keep moving, no matter how many skies keep falling.

glhf. Later.
