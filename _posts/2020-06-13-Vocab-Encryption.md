# **Encryption**

Encryption is as old as secrets themselves. Stated simply - to encrypt something means to hide or obscure it using a chosen method.

## **Word Salad**

Let’s look at an example using a "_Shift Value_". A shift value substitutes a letter's position in the alphabet for another's based on a number. If `A=1, B=2, C=3...` and our `shift value = 2` then `A` would move to the `3` position of our new super secret friend alphabet. `A=3, B=4, C=5`. Now instead of writing the word `HELLO` we write `JGNNQ` since each letter has been moved by `2`.

```
H E L L O

⇅ ⇅ ⇅ ⇅ ⇅

J G N N Q
```


We can then use this newly formed alphabet to send messages that make little sense to someone not in our secret clubhouse. Won't they feel foolish!

If we were to shift by a greater value like `13` our "_code_" (our "_encryption_") becomes more secure. `A=14, B=15, C=16` would yield text that looks like the following:

```
H E L L O

⇅ ⇅ ⇅ ⇅ ⇅

U R Y Y B
```

This particular encryption method is called a "Caesar Cipher" and was used by Julius Caesar as a form of encryption for his correspondence.
