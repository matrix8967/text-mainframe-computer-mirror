# Felt cute; might delete l8r 💁‍♀️
This site started in one direction and quickly became exhausting.

It's still in the [commit history](https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/text-mainframe-computer/-/tree/8a74263efe8de6a24ae5286416e7011473ca6cf5) and could be resurrected or expanded later. 🤷

I still have a lot of content from an old site that focused on providing actionable ways for people to do some digital self-care.

I need a more general braindump instead of a hyper-focused and niche subject matter that asks a lot.

I always spend a lot of time creating these static content sites, and then silently delete them.

Usually out of embarrassment that I've expressed some kind of genuine emotions in such a public way.

_How embarrassing._

It's just _disgusting._

With that said - I am hoping to provide a bit of levity when approaching technical subjects.

Try to express an honest, human, introspective voice without it devolving into hammered horse shit.

I _also_ understand how foolish it is to be so _sentimental_ about things like consumer electronics manufactured under dubious conditions.

No ads, or tracking, viewer counts, affiliate links or whatever.

That shit exists to upset you because _happy people don't buy shit._

This thing is kind of a lust letter to the _weird_ and _dynamic_ internet I grew up with.

Just some nobody, an internet connection, and pure unadulterated ~~garbage~~ text files baby.

Should be a fuckin' cringe-fest so smash that mf like button and le'go.
