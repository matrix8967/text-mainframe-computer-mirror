# Terminal Illness

## CLI? More like CL-WHY

There are any number of reasons someone would choose to operate a device via Command Line Interface (`CLI`) instead of a Graphical User Interface (`GUI`).

* Commands are precise, providing *exact* instructions.
* CLIs often require less resource utilization.
* Accessibility / Ergonomic reasons.
* `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Terminal? Shell?

#### Shell:

A `shell` in the context of computing is a program that exposes an Operating Systems internal components to a user. It's name comes from being the _outer most layer_ of the Operating System. Shells can be graphical or text-based - however we'll be focusing on the `CLI.`

* `sh`
* `bash`
* `zsh`

#### Terminal:

A `terminal` has a _long_ history in Telecommunication, even predating the Telephone. We're going to skipfrom the humble beginnings of the `Teletypewriter` (`TTY`) straight to the 1970's as the idea of a modernterminal began to take shape.

Modern Terminals evolved right along with the rest of computer science - In College Labs along with the `Arpanet` and the `Mainframe.` Computers were the size of rooms - so it was in everyone's best interest to keep the college kids separate from sensitive equipment by setting up a Terminal as a way to provide instructions to the hardware.

Most of us think of a Terminal as launching your favorite application on your computer - which is true. However - modern computers are able to run multiple terminals, applications, connections, tasks all at the same time.

Many terminals could only launch a single application: A `CLI` shell to provide instructions.

* `xterm`
* `konsole`
* `kitty`
* `iTerm2`
* `PuTTY`

## Toolin' around

* `tmux`
* `vim`
* `nano`
	* `nano` > `vim`
* `bat`
	* Servers   == Default
	* Your shit == w/e

## Sound & Color
* `ANSI`
* https://github.com/shiena/ansicolor/blob/master/README.md
* mplayer etc etc

## _At LEAST_ 13 pieces of flare

* `figlet` - The oldest and the fatherless.
    * figfonts - But remember - servers get defaults.
* `glow`
* `bat`
* `lolcat`
* `asciinema`
* `svg-term`

## Termux - all the power of your favorite shell - with 90% more pain:

## Cool work shirt tho.
