## Terminal? Shell? CLI?

#### CLI? More like CL-WHY:

There are any number of reasons someone would choose to operate a device via Command Line Interface (`CLI`) instead of a Graphical User Interface (`GUI`).

-   Commands are precise, providing _exact_ instructions.
-   CLIs often require less resource utilization.
-   Accessibility / Ergonomic reasons.
-   `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

#### Shell:

A `shell` in the context of computing is a program that exposes an Operating Systems internal components to a user. It's name comes from being the _outer most layer_ of the Operating System. Shells can be graphical or text-based - however we'll be focusing on the `CLI.`

-   `sh`
-   `bash`
-   `zsh`

#### Terminal:

A `terminal` has a _long_ history in Telecommunication, even predating the Telephone. We're going to skip from the humble beginnings of the `Teletypewriter` (`TTY`) straight to the 1970's where the idea of a modern terminal began to take shape.

But I'm leaving some links in the footnote for some light bathroom reading. [^1]

Modern Terminals evolved right along with the rest of computer science - In College Labs along with the `ARPANET` and the `Mainframe.`

Computers were the size of rooms - so it was in everyone's best interest to keep the college kids separate from sensitive equipment by setting up a remote Terminal as a way for users to interact with hardware.

Most of us think of a Terminal as launching your favorite _Terminal_ application on your computer - which is mostly true. However - modern computers are able to run multiple terminals, applications, connections, tasks all at the same time.

Many terminals could only launch a single application: A `CLI` shell to provide instructions. Obviously with modern computational horse power - we can open _many_ applications, and then use a terminal to hide the windows so our boss thinks we're busy.

Some popular Terminal Emulators for various operating systems are:

-   `xterm`
-   `konsole`
-   `kitty`
-   `iTerm2`
-   `PuTTY`

I personally find myself coming back to `kitty` because of it's flexibility and plethora of features. It's a great way to create a unified experience on almost any platform. But I'll use whatever is laying around.

Rather than make this üëåÔ∏è for 6 months -- I'm just going to drop the first part and start on the 2nd/3rd parts as I go.
