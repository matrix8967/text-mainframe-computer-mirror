# tl;dr up top:

* I'm dumping all my unfinished drafts.
* You'll have to view the site's source code to see the drafts branch.
* I hate this - and it's kind of a step towards self-improvement do show my work in it's larva-state.

Like anyone worth knowing -- I've got a myriad of flaws and shortcomings.

To generalize one of these, it's safe to say I have problems *Letting Go.* Specifically - letting go of my work.

I've got an extensive volume of childhood trauma related to my academic career, and a whole chapter dedicated to being the last kid to turn in an assignment or test while the rest of the class is held prisoner at their desks while I start my 3rd round of proofreading...

* "You've got time to do it _right;_ you don't have time to do it _twice._"

Another insecurity in the *9pm-truck-stop-buffet* of my mind is: lacking a creative outlet. The closest thing I have to a creative outlet is -- you guessed it -- writing. Despite a for-real publication under my belt, and a lifetime of encouragement and feedback -- I still consider anything I write to be about as interesting as a community theater rendition of a tax return.

-----

So when these two misfiring pistons get in sync, I end up frozen in a stagnant bog of mediocrity.

I also tend to keep my creative endeavors unseen until they're in a somewhat completed state because I don't want to show off my half-finished progress, and prematurely bask in people's feedback/praise. Like edging - but for your creative dopamine rush.

* Nothing's more deadly than the traps we set for ourselves.
* The shadows that start at our own feet are always the tallest.

  
I've had a growing backlog of posts for this site (and others) that are half-finished because it's been impossible to sit down and churn out some words in peace for the past year.

So - I'm doing something that I never do - I'm dumping all my drafts out there for the world to see. I'm shouting some of my secrets I guess. `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

## Y tho:

* Embarrassment is the cost of entry...

My hope is once these are out - I'll finally be able to get some *new* writing done, instead of sitting down and falling into the traps I've set for myself that keep me from even _starting_ any writing, let alone _finishing_ any.

Since `~2018` I've had various blog series that focus on taking all the _deepweb netsec fedora-tipping basement-dwelling_ security street-smarts and distilling those down for _the normies._ However - over the years, other blogs and content creators have pretty much covered these - while also having some kind of name/brand weight.

(Specific shoutout to _Mullvad_ for really distilling this into what I hoped to build all those years ago.)

If you're reading this - there's a 99.9% chance that I linked you here for something. Not because my hot-take is a beacon of truth and common sense in the tech industry.

Lastly, I'm at a point in my writing where the only way for it to improve is for it to endure the crucible of _feedback._

So with all that ~~said~~ written: [Here's the link to my shame.](https://gitlab.com/matrix8967/text-mainframe-computer/-/tree/feat/word-bench)
