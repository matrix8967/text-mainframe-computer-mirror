## "Yeah, but _I've_ got nothing to hide!"

But you have locks on your doors right? Curtains on your windows? You close the door when you go to the bathroom? You're not doing anything wrong. But you still have a reasonable right to privacy.

While you _think_ you might have nothing to hide, [Police Dragnets](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html) courtesy of Google's location tracking think otherwise.

> The police told the suspect, Jorge Molina, they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier. They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing, potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the area.

Marginalized voices need protection now more than ever before.

Meanwhile, Tech companies hide behind the _frail_ hashtags of their PR Departments. Dozens of social media posts showing _solemn looking marionettes_ assured us that companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook stand behind minorities.

This is thinly veiled sleight of hand to distract from Big Tech's discrimination and it's relationship with the Police State.

Amazon's Ring Doorbell and Neighbors app are directly [linked to your local PD](https://www.wired.com/story/ces-2020-amazon-defends-ring-police-partnerships/) to tap into footage from your camera. In some cases Local PDs were kind enough to install them ~~upon~~ for [citizens.](https://gizmodo.com/ring-gave-police-stats-about-users-who-said-no-to-law-e-1837713840)

> In Fort Lauderdale, police went to dozens of homes and helped residents install Ring cameras after holding raffles at neighborhood watch meetings and handing them out for free. According to emails obtained by Gizmodo, the officers were specifically instructed by superiors to verify that the winners downloaded Ringâ€™s Neighbors app so they could receive police requests. The Fort Lauderdale Police Department did not respond to requests for comment made Thursday.

When paired with Amazon's [woefully inaccurate](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28) facial recognition software, it's of little wonder why groups are speaking out against these practices. Especially considering facial recognition heavily [discriminates](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/28/18201204/amazon-facial-recognition-dark-skinned-women-mit-study) against BIPOC.

As BLM Protests in MN continued into the first night, Customs and Border Patrol agents flew a [predator drone](https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/5dzbe3/customs-and-border-protection-predator-drone-minneapolis-george-floyd) around the city. We've also seen drone aircraft used [in the 2015 BLM Baltimore Protests](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/fbi-releases-secret-spy-plane-footage-freddie-gray) sparked by the murder of Freddie Gray. Agencies like CBP [seem to struggle keeping flight records](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4x3dxd/the-us-border-patrol-misplaced-the-records-for-200-predator-drone-flights) for many unmanned drone flights, meanwhile more and more [unmarked militant police](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/05/protests-washington-dc-federal-agents-law-enforcement-302551) arrive in Washington DC.

* It is possible to make weak locks.
* It *is not* possible to make locks that open based on morality or good intentions.
