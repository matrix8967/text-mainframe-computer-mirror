Computer Networks are complicated. Securing them is often more complicated.

The focus of this guide *is not* to provide an irrefutable workflow to be "secure."

The focus of this guide *is not* to follow every single word to the letter.

The focus of this guide *is* to provide a quick reference for beginners (and forgetful old-hats) with ways they can improve their day-to-day security posture.

For example an Administrative Assistant may require a different set of tools for handling secure documents compared to a political activist.

* If you're brand new - I would recommend familiarizing yourself with a few `Terms` that will make reading these guides and blog posts a little easier.

* If you feel firm on your feet with the jargon, feel free to browse around in any order.  

I'm doing my best to make each guide self-contained, immediately actionable, and bite-sized. Assuming no knowledge on the reader's behalf outside of terms, which will be in the linked reference page.
