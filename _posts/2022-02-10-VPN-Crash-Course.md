# tl;dr at the top:

Use [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/). You can read [why](https://mullvad.net/en/why-mullvad-vpn/) from their site, which provides verifiable information about every aspect of their technology - not thinly veiled advertisements masqurading as blog posts. Their dedication to Privacy and Transparency is unrivaled - and verifiable from their actions.

If Mullvad doesn't work for you -- I'm also a fan of [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/). They're another bastion of ethical, privacy focused engineering in all their services.

If you're reading this -- there is a `99.9%` chance that you know me personally, and I sent you this link because we talked about VPNs. Use this one.

# Why's and Wherefores:

One of the most _actionable_ steps someone can take to start taking control of their digital-life is to use a reputable VPN (Virtual Private Network.)

A VPN is an intermediate/middle-man connection that can be used to mask your real connection details.

For example - If you're located in the USA, but you wanna _weeb the fuck out_ on some obscure Anime - you can connect to your VPN, then set your VPN's location to _Japan_ which will make all the sites you visit for the duration of your connection assume you're visiting from the Land of the Rising Sun. You'll have access to whatever Netflix or CrunchyRoll make available to that country -- all without signing out of your accounts.

# Choice Paralysis

There are different VPNs for different use cases.

Most consumer VPNs (that you may know from constant shilling by your favorite YouTube creators) range from "Kinda Sketch" to "Super Sketch."

Some make no attempt to claim any kind of privacy protections - as it's not in the scope of their product. That's a fair and respectable stance.

However, Most of these unscrupulous VPN providers will make _claims_ of Privacy -- but have a provable track record of bad practices.

I'm not paid by Mullvad/ProtonVPN -- Those are just the two provider's I recommend based on my own research and testing. Feel free to choose your own adventure based on your own needs, budget, and available technology.

*Most of the time* even a *kinda sketch* VPN is better than NO VPN...Most of the time...

# Trust Issues:

Since you're now connecting to the internet using an intermediate connection - I cannot understate the amount of trust you will be putting into your VPN Provider.

This is the biggest reason I initially chose Mullvad - their transparent, open, and verifiable trust they focus on with their VPN Offerings.

Fun Fact: One of the reasons I find it so hard to write content for this blog is directly related to the [Mullvad Blog](https://mullvad.net/en/what-is-vpn/) being a much more organized, and approachable resource for the things I want to cover.[^1] 

I don't have a big enough ego to pretend to be upset about a better repository for information to help people take control of their digital lives. The more the merrier.
