# Passwords

Setup a Password Manager. I use Bitwarden, but you have a free `1Password` Family Account since you use it here at work. You can set that up by logging into `my.1password.com` and going to the `settings` page. Just don't use your _work_ email address to set it up, that way if/when you leave Apptegy, you don't lose your entire family's access to your credentials. Don't cross the streams; separate church and state, ya know?

You can use [this website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to check your various email addresses and see what accounts have been exposed in data breaches.

If you see a service you use has been breached it would be a good idea to consider whatever password you used as "public knowledge."

# Mozilla

Mozilla (the non-profit that builds Firefox) offers _A LOT_ of basic services for free with their account service. They also provide a _ton_ a excellent documentation and knowledge all for the public good and the health of the Internet.

## Relay

`Firefox Relay` allows you to create "burner" email addresses that forward to a final destination address. This way _WHEN_ your credentials are exposed in a data breach, the information is useless. The password you created in your Password Manager is easily replaced, and now the _other_ half of that equation is just as disposable. This way your email address doesn't get bombed with spam, or the years of phishing attempts that will come after your email shows up in credential dumps.

## Containers

Multi-Account Containers allow you to Isolate and Jail off individual browser tabs from one another. For Development, this has a ton of uses. But - from a privacy standpoint, this will stop advertising trackers from following you around the internet. You can set up filters so that certain sites _only_ open up in isolated tabs.

# Ad Blocker(s)

Using a good AdBlocker is a near-effortless step in increasing your overall _digital diet_. If we think so much about what we put in our bodies, we should also think about what we put in our brains and where it comes from. I'm a fan of the "Farm-to-Table" digital experience.

`uBlock Origin` is a great AdBlocker for your browser, and has a ton of features. Using it's `eyedropper` tool to get around websites fullscreen element paywalls is one use. You can add custom filters for blocking other annoying things on the web.

# Searching

Lastly, changing your default search engine from `Google` over to `DuckDuckGo` is another great step towards increasing privacy _AANNDD_ productivity. I get _vastly_ superior search results from `DDG` than I do from `Google` _especially_ for technical searches in our field of work. If you can't find what you're looking for in the first search result, you simply add `!g` to your search, and `DDG` will proxy your search to Google. They do this with _hundreds_ of other sites as well. `!w` will search Wikipedia, etc.

They also use a browser extension that helps you search, but also rates websites based on the sites privacy standards. I'll include it at the bottom with a list of other web extensions I use.
