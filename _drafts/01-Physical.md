Few Things:
    * Speeds are measured in megaBITS =/= megaBYTES.
    * mbps = megabits per second.
    * MBps = MegaBytes per second.
    * mbps / 8 = ~MBps.

OSI Model:

    01.) Physical
    02.) Data
    03.) Network
    04.) Transport
    05.) Session
    06.) Presentation
    07.) Application

Physical Layer: How bits get from point A -> Point B.

Wifi:
    Intro:
        * 802.11 (b/g/n, ac, ax.)
        * 2.4ghz, 5.0ghz

    Common Issues:
        * Physical Interference (Metal, etc.)
        * Spectrum Interference (Co-Channel Interference).
        * Packet Loss. (VoIP / WebRTC. and other UDP traffic.)

Ethernet:
    Intro:
        * Categories Cat5e, Cat6(A/E), Cat7(A), Cat8.
        * Physical limit of ~328 feet (100 meters).
        * Cat6 speeds up to 1gbps, Cat8 speeds up to 25gbps.

    Common Issues:
        * Breakage / Rodents.
        * Interfernece (flourescent lights.)
        * Poor Shielding / Cross-Talk.
