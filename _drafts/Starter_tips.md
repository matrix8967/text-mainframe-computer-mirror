#### A quick note to beginners on this:

This can be *significantly* more difficult when getting started, because your first build(s) require a complete ground-up investment. When you're starting your 2nd build, you can up-cycle MANY components: Cases, Drives, Fans, Power Supplies, and Cables can all be easily upgraded for much longer than the life span of other components. (I still have many of these components from some of my first builds.) These are a monument to future-tolerant designs and are a measurable victory for open-standards.

Even your 2nd and 3rd builds may not be as easy for this "one piece at a time" mindset if you find yourself needing to replace those parts that *can* migrate, but for performance or compatibility reasons may not directly translate. While you MAYBE able to lean on friends or family or local building groups to resell some of these parts to offset the cost of new equipment - also understand there's a very limited market for your year(s) old, constantly used power supply

Recently, I realized I've been building and modifying computers for well over half my life. Which means there could be something someone finds insightful.

Understand that this build is the most recent result from _decades_ of successes, failures, disappointments, regrets, poor financial planning, and lots of luck of varying degrees. It isn't that I'm a perfectionist - it's that I'm obsessive, and nothing will ever be good enough for me. Things I'll be covering didn't happen at once, and *nobody* is "self-made." Embarrassment is the cost of entry.

If you're just starting out, you'll have to make some compromises to fit your budget or use case. It can be hard to stifle the "step sell" of components. But a lot of very useful parts can be upcycled for many years. Power supplies, cases, fans, drives, cables, have been using slight variations of the same standards and change slowly over time.

Early Adoption might look great if you're watching a subtly paid advert from a youtube streamer - but *you* won't have access to the brand sponsor support staff that swoop in at a moments notice to fix issues before they become noticeable.

There's a *lot* of ego-boosting stat quoting and false senses of superiority in the field. Being able to easily measure and analyize and compare results of hardware stress tests can be a real validating and gratifying way to feel proud of what you built. You feel proud to have passed such an arduous gauntlet with something that *you* built. You absolutely should be proud! But you should still feel just as proud even if some of those numbers are slouching in the middle of the pack, or maybe even bringing up the caboose.

Stress tests were once mostly used to verify the integrity of a build and the actual results were usually discarded. People who built their own liquid cooling loops could use them to verify the fittings were sealed because running a CPU under intense conditions for an unreasonable amount of time serves as a way to verify: "If it can do this, my daily use case of video editing and video games will be a walk in the cake."

They've started to take on a way for people to feel they've built a "better" machine than others.

When you're planning a build - start with a mentality of "take only what you need." This forces you to focus on a specific and measurable objective. This places the focus on a build that's suited to _you_ and _your needs_ and helps to cut through needlessly wasteful spending and spec chasing. Understanding your needs will help you build a machine that you feel is the most rewarding, for the longest span of time.

There will *always* be a new part "about to come out."
