# What's in a Name?

The name - besides the obvious nod to the Black/Red color palette I managed to adhere to - is a combination of sentimental bullshit that carried me here.

I landed on `RedWheelbarrow` as a subtle way to pay tribute to `Mr. Robot` the most resonant and meaningful body of art I've experienced in my life. It's hard to imagine this machine as anything else.

The name also lends itself to it's role in life - just like a _literal_ Wheelbarrow - this machine is a simple, clever work horse to be used with purpose. I'm planning a future post on the nuanced benefits of a desktop form-factor in the future. But suffice to say - it feels more important now than ever to be able to keep the work at the workstation, and the play at the playstation.

The Original `The Red Wheelbarrow` a 1923 Poem by William Carlos Williams echoes the design objectives I was striving for.

It's a terse and firm structure that says everything it needs to, and nothing more.
