# I don't beg to differ - I just fucking differ.

A lust letter to the Illusion of safety.

This isn't the first time I've been here. This isn't the first time I've been here with this hardware. You could say this isn't the first time I've been here with this hardware for this same reason. But those words would be doing too much heavy lifting in my opinion.

This _feels_ like it should _look_ like a nightmare. Something inside of me should be worried. This expensive equipment that's the corner stone to my productivity zen garden has _once again_ fired off a `OTA` firmware update that ended up being a 1-way-trip. I should be mad. I should feel like I've been betrayed by those I trusted.

So why do I feel trepedation and wonder over this manufactored crisis?

It's because I have good back ups, ok thanks for reading see ya later. :wave:

[The first time this laptop bricked](https://mastodon.social/@matrix8967/104379093685416474) from a firmware update was 3 months ago to the day. I remember it was a friday - and right as I'd installed a firmware update, I got a slack notification on mobile needing some information. "No problem, I just did an update on my machine and when it's finished I can get it over to you." Again - I should be upset, or panicking, or something. But, I'm not an EMT, nobody's gonna die. I figured it was just something I'd done or something. A quick peek at the usual sounding boards didn't show much, so I quietly continued on with other things. But after about 30 more minutes, I just couldn't shake the feeling about a OTA Firmware update bricking a healthy system in such a niche hardware market. I just couldn't help but wonder: Did I just push the button first - and have enough hardware to not worry about it?" A second look at Github, Reddit, and so on confirmed my suspicions -- 2, or 3, or 5, or 10 posts late friday singing the same refrain: Healthy `darp6` --> Firmware Update --> Softbrick.

And, of course it's late friday evening on a Holiday weekend in the US. And small niche hardware markets are still generally staffed by human beings. As a fellow human being, I'm happy many of us are allowed to be off work during that time.
