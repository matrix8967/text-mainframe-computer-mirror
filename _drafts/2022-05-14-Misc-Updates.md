# Brain Storms.

Brains seem like such poorly designed system...I mean, it's a lump of fat with some electricity running through it. What's the best case scenario there?

* * *

Anyway, I'm determined to not let _this_ blog die...at least not in the same way my others have died...

Believe it or not - the field of Technology is an evershifting ecosystem.

One day you're working at a Bay Area social media network, content with the role you're playing on the world stage...

And later that afternoon, a shitposting goblin techbro decides to buy out your employer for a price that's more than many countries entire GDP.

* * *

As my list of topics I want to touch on grows each day, my old enemy _executive dysfunction_ sings it's tiresome refrain:

> "Look at all this...Why even start?"

* * *

Another misfiring piston in the engines of my mind is an absolute refusal to put my name on anything I view as subpar...

It's _OCD_, but not in the cute way people say when they have strong opinions about table settings or the _dank memes_ you see on pinterest...

It's the ugly-crying-hyper-ventalating doom spiral over _SOMETHING_ that your brain has decided will be your albatross.

_For me_, it's hardly ever the samething twice - and it'll _always_ be something that nobody sees or cares about.

* * *

The icing on this 3-tiered layer cake of self-depreciation is my absolute _refusal_ to be nice (or even _reasonable_) with myself about anything I do...or don't do.

* * *

And _by these powers combined_ - I transform from mild mannerd, well intentioned technologist into a mute observer of my own life.

Like a voltron of misfiring synapses.

In a previous post - I linked to a huge dump of stillborn articles that may or maynot ever see the light of day in the prestigious halls of this site.

I was really only able to reconcile this by putting the unfinished content into a separate branch of the site's sourcecode...This way the unfinished content was _very much_ available, but not cluttering up the main content.

# Digital Adrenaline Junky:

Another double-edged-sword of my specific cocktail of brain chemicals plays into this too.

Once I've got the site(s) off the ground - I get pretty stir crazy.

This isn't new - even as a bright eyed young technologist, I would spend summers maticulously configuring projects until the sun would peek through the window and remind me:

I mean - where's the _thrill_ of using _stable_ software? 😏️

Once I know that a link works when I click it -- where's the sense of adventure?

Calm seas don't yield worthy captains.

# Uh...Cool. u ok?

Yarp.

Anything I post here are things I feel I'm in a healthier place about, or am making good progress.

No offense, _Dear Reader_, but this is not the platform I run to when things are still raw.

...I post that shit on my _OnlyFans_. 😏️ (jk)

Since that post - I've posted two articles that I'm not really happy with as the lowest stakes version of immersion therapy...

Still trying to nail down what workflow will be best for these things.

I at least made a skeletal `TO-DO` list for the messiest one.

Anyway - all that to say: Shit's been wild. But at least if this blog joins the graveyard of abandoned Xanga, MySpace, Blogger, Medium, _whatever_, blogs - future Inter-naughts can look back and say:

> "He was trying."

A blog is just conversations that nobody IRL wants to have with you anyway.
