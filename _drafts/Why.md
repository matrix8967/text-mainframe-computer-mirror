Too often I hear the argument: “Well, I don’t have anything to hide. So I don’t care.” This is often said by the same people who lock their front doors, or have curtains on their windows.

Now -- imagine with me for a moment: A Person walks up to you, snatches your phone out of your hands, and proceeds to note every call you've made, the time stamp of every message, who it was to, GPS logs, cell tower logs, bluetooth logs, and all of your biometric data (thank you, fitness devices.) Now imagine this person starts guessing what you were doing at that time. You’d probably be a little upset. After all, it's none of their business, right? After your information has been bought, sold, paid for, stolen, then used against you; you can rest easy knowing that Uncle Sam is going to be sure to bail out the huge corporations that are at fault, so long as they keep lining pockets.

I feel that a lot of the apathy stems from the fog and doublespeak shrouding the immediate threat. When you browse Google, Facebook, or Amazon you won’t see the hundreds of bots scouring your data like you would see a person peeking over your shoulder. You won’t see the eerily accurate profile they've built about you in order to sell you things. It’s all metadata. It’s the story behind the data: How long you looked at a page, if you clicked any links, how long you were on the site, where you were, what time it was, which user(s) were signed into a device. Even the orientation and gyroscopes can tell someone if you’re laying in bed, driving, or on the toilet. All of this is information is worth money to ad companies and worth much more to malicious actors.

In the 90’s, the internet was a...unique place. Women didn't specify a gender, because they could be treated equally. Men could break away from the chains of masculinity to proudly proclaim: "19/f/cali!" And children were undercover federal agents.

At face value, today’s internet can seem terrifying in comparison. With the 1984 Dystopian Reality we’re living in it can be overwhelming. You can be scared, or you can be scared brave.

After all, you’re not doing anything wrong when you go to the bathroom; but it’s likely you still shut the door.

Let's start with [some terms](Terms).
