    * Place holder for a future Retrospective Build.
    * Trends I'm looking into towards the future.
        * Artisan / truly custom builds. (S/O System76 & Alex)
        * Tech that doesn't have to try so hard to look as sophisticated as it actually is.
        * Designing an Artisan Component where there is no logo - except for something tasteful hidden away deep inside the component itself.
            * The only people who'd ever know what the logo looked like would be hobbyists and tinkerers.
            * Everything tries to shove a fucking logo in your face now days - and this opposite tasteful and _respectful_ approach sounds refreshing.

* Embarassing Emotional Rhetoric
    * I specifically made this as awful sounding as possible.
