# Communications

In the early days of Telecommunication, eaves dropping was child’s play. Many phone lines were a single phone line for an entire street called a “Party Line.” All one needed to do to listen in on a sultry conversation was to unscrew the mouthpiece of their telephone to prevent any background noise from traveling over the line and enjoy whatever juicy gossip was happening in the neighborhood.

As time marched on, communication became more sophisticated, and quickly started to out pace crude tricks. However, just as technology advanced, so did the tricks that malicious entities could employ to gain access to your private communications.

On your current text messaging service...

-   Can you verify that your message made it to the recipient uninterrupted?

-   Can you verify that data is not stored or being shared?

-   Can you verify the identity of the message recipient?

For example whatsapp is owned by Facebook. Facebook claims that it cannot read user messages. But do you trust Facebook to tell you the truth? Which seems more likely: Facebook is operating whatsapp out of altruism, or Facebook is operating whatsapp to further it’s data aggregation and profiling markets?

If you’re reading this -- then it’s likely that you already know the answer to that question. So let’s start looking at ways you can communicate effortlessly, seamlessly, and securely.

## Signal

Without a doubt, Signal is the big name when it comes to easy and secure communications. When you download the app on Android, Signal will act as regular text messenger to those who are not also on Signal. But, when the other users are on Signal, you benefit from End to End Encrypted, Zero Knowledge text messaging ([Terms](Terms)). There’s also a desktop app that will let you do any texting you need from your computer, so you don’t have to pull out your phone to send a quick text. Essentially, this is a more secure iMessage for all operating systems.

## Proton Mail

Proton Mail has everything that you’re looking for in an Email application. It’s End to End Encrypted, Zero Knowledge and has 2FA ([Terms](Terms)). It has a free tier limited to 500 Megabytes, and then paid tiers after that. This does, however, come with some responsibility on the users -- If you lose your encryption passphrases, or 2FA keys, you will be locked out of your account forever. Protonmail can wipe your account and set it up as new...but they’ll never be able to let you into your old account if you’ve forgotten your information.

At first glance, this may seem scary, or harsh. However with good password management (link) this will be no issue. And this also ensures that nobody can access your private email

## Riot.im/Matrix.org

Riot and Matrix.org are a different breed of animal, but it’s still worth mentioning. This may not be for beginners, but it maybe very useful for intermediate and advanced users. Matrix.org is a service that hosts it’s own encrypted communications, but you can also spin up your own home server if you wish. It’s FOSS, End to End Encrypted, Zero Knowledge, and Federated ([Terms](Terms)). Riot.im is the application you use to chat/call/video with. Basically -- Matrix.org is the backend. Riot.im is the front end application.

These applications can also bridge with apps like Slack, and IRC, thus putting all your different communications in one app. It’s User Interface and User Experience leave some room for improvement, (especially with End to End Encrypted Devices) but over all, it’s a promising project with a wide array of uses.
