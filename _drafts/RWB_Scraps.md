This ended up being a much needed, and completely unexpected meditative healing moment for me.

I'd hit a bit of snag, and was feeling like I was "falling behind" the time I'd imagined in my head that this would take.

I don't know why, but I suddenly stopped and almost without thinking or knowing or understanding until I was well into the process - I found myself rejecting the idea that there was *any* sort of time I needed to be finished with this build.

I did something I've not been able to do in so long.

I was able to slow down, and I was able move through my work peacefully.

I spent so much time running cables, finding ways to layer them as I was running them while thinking:

Which components are the most likely to need to be replaced from failure?

Which will require some sort of maintenance?

What can I imagine adding to this machine, that might require cables to move through this area in the future?

Since my front fan grill is able to be removed, it might be a good idea to make sure my fan cables are run through a separate or easier path so that cleaning is faster and easier. Which means it will happen more often.

A lot of  the final pieces of this build are focused on something I've not ever really spent TOO much time considering: Fans, Cooling, and Noise Level.

I've never been bothered by the sound of fans from a computer, and I actually lean on that sound as white noise for falling asleep. As we'll touch on later - this build carried on longer than I'd anticipated and I honestly don't really recall actually falling to sleep because even in it's quietest configurations - I still latched on to the sound of the fans from my computer. 

It's a sound of stability. Of working. Comfort. Growing up - no what great strife I was having to face down, I could always look towards our family computer as a kind of security blanket. 

I remember the night we got our first computer. It was my uncle's old laptop he'd had in college - and like all computers from that era, it was hilariously inept at being elegant or subtle. It was a burly and unapologetic mammoth.

I remember when he opened it up. The sounds, the smell of hot ozone that probably did untold damage to me. The blurry ghosted words smearing around the display. It went black, and suddenly a welcoming peppy chime and a photograph of Stone Henge. I recognized it from whatever PBS show I was thankfully subjected to.

He spent what seemed like an eternity showing my parents the fine art of managine files, navigating through the files system, and the timeless bloodletting of managing creating an maintaining documents. All while I sat impatiently waiting for games.

It got late. The games never arrived, and I remember spending so much time waiting for the boring stuff to be over, so that I could "play" the picture of Stone Henge.

Lots of thanks were had, and warm feelings, the computer was shut, and I was condemmed to my bedroom. Where I didn't sleep out of spite, and as soon as I felt I could fake having slept, I scurried to this new bi-fold universe with one goal in mind - play stone henge.

I'm sure I don't have to convey my disappointment as it dawned on me that my quest to play this photograph of stone henge was met with the realization of what a wallpaper is.

Once - while exploring the strange, boxy, corporate-friendly colorscheme alien device I was obsessed with - I'd unknowingly selected and opened every file available to me at once.

One by one - documents, programs, windows tried to open. The machine groaned under the obvious load. I panicked and began hammering at keys. I remember that I hardly knew the alphabet in *any* form - so whatever this `qwerty` business was would have to wait. 

Nothing was working. The machine seemed to grow more angry and more determined to fulfill my accidental wish for it's self destruction.

This new world I hardly knew or understood was destroying itself in front of me. Because I'd unknowingly told it to.

The severity of the situation grew in my tiny mind as my eyes filled with tears. I knew which button was used as the ignition to this Engine of wonder.

All I could think was to press the button as a way to tell the computer that it should stop. The friendly Black Screen with Orange Text that assured me it was safe was nowhere to be seen. This was an emergency, and if nothing else - I would end the suffering I'd brought upon my new friend.

Tears streaked down my face and a thousand "sorry"'s puked from my mouth. A quick button press, and it was over. I turned the machine back on willing to accept whatever damage I'd caused. To my relief everything was as it was. Amnesiac. Like nothing ever happened.

However - something foolish inside of me that seeks honesty in all things no matter the cost decided to offer myself up to my parents as a sacrifice for what I'd done. I explained to my parents what had happened and they also were not sure about the nuances of my carelessnes.

Sometime later - we were visiting my uncle. I remember walking in, seeing Lewis on the couch as my (maybe?) 4 year old self shimmied onto the couch. Beavis and Butthead were on - we didn't have cable but I recognized them from the way the news ladies were always talking trash about them (and The Simpsons, and Ren and Stimpy, and everything else I watched if I knew someone had cable.) Lewis looked over at me, held a serious face, and in his deep "chill personified" voice asked: "You 14?" I laughed and said "No." He laughed and said: "Cool." A very positive experience from my first brush with male initiation rituals.

I was soon summoned back to the cave of my uncle's room. I figured this was where the punishment(s) would begin. I braced for attonement.

After describing everything I knew about what I'd done - My uncle sat me in his lap, put my tiny hand on a Logitech Trackball - Blood read speckled marble that rolled around like a billiard ball seemingly forever. 

He explained what I'd done was called "Rubberbanding." 90's interfaces were obsessed with the idea that your computer had to mimmic parts of an actual desk because they felt users were too stuipd and needed to be coddled. Rubberbanding was the action of clicking and dragging, which showed a dotted outline that was supposed to represent a rubberband. As you dragged the rubberband around various files it would "gather them" and once they were gathered (by releasing the mouse button) you could then perform an action. Since I only understood a few buttons - mostly based around size rather than w/e hyroglyphs were on them - I pressed enter.

I felt so much relief. In such a small exchange - I learned so much.
