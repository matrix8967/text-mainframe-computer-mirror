# Password Management

Quick Note - I completely wiped this page out and am starting fresh with less "wall of text" and more quick and actionable items. Still under construction... 6-14-19.

## The Short Summary:

There are many password managers out there, but we'll be using Bitwarden in this example. Bitwarden has an excellent free-tier, but is also a minimal expense for the service that it provides. You can also host it on your own server, if you'd rather not trust Bitwarden's own infrastructure. It has a stand alone application, or is compatible with Firefox and Chrome based web browsers.

1.) Bitwarden is a [FOSS](Terms) Password Manager. It will generate and store long and complex passwords for each of your online accounts.

2.) When a service is breached, only that unique password will be burned, and it will not allow access to your other online accounts.

## Choosing a Master Password.

### DO:

-   Think of a passphrase, instead of a password. There's no upper limit on characters, so a favorite quote from a book, movie, or game is great.
-   **Example:** "_The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't._"
-   Use words that would not appear next to each other in a dictionary. (1Password can generate these for you.)
-   **Example:** _modesty-variant-malice-carven_
-   Use complex and interesting characters. (Brackets, Backticks, Pipes, ASCII, Unicode, and Emojis.)
-   **Example:** " (つ•̀ᴥ•́)つ:･ﾟ✧ \|V\| @G\|CAL"

### DON'T:

-   Use any of the examples above without chaging them. :)

-   Use a password you've ever used before. New Year; New You.

-   Use any dates of any format.

-   Use names of any kind.
