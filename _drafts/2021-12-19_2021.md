# Nazis are back.

2021 has felt like the hardest decade of my life. Never has time felt more like a flat circle. Each day like a lost dog.

However, despite however many skies have fallen, 2021 will at least serve as a catalyst for major change. Personally, Globally, Politically, Literally, figuratively, whatever-ly.

The year started with _yet another_ [unprecedented history defining event for me to witness.](https://mastodon.social/@matrix8967/105512453491508428)

As I watched a gaggle of hens swarm the US Capital on Jan. 6th, I felt that all-too-familiar feeling that nothing would ever be the same again. I was reminded of a [passage from my favorite book](https://mastodon.social/@matrix8967/105517637337987066) that always rings my stomach when I read it...And I watched a Store-Brand version of the words unfolding in my nations capital.

At least _this time_ the _gravy seals/Y'all Queda_ didn't manage to _completely_ succeed in their primary objectives. But Jan. 6th was another swirl in the crooked spine the country has been growing into for the past ~40 years or so.

Call me old fashioned - but I miss the days when Nazis had uniforms so you could pick 'em out of a crowd.

But - there's plenty of shit we can focus on to spiral into new depths of misery. Instead - I'm going to use this post to puke up some of the things I've found this year that have helped keep the _good chemicals_ trickling into my brain.

# Music:

Music has always been the fuel for the furnace inside my head.

<iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/466v2b7gzlnGpcdHDZzZxC?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>

I did my best to divide the above playlist by Genre, and give it a _somewhat_ cohesive feel between the tracks.

Bo Burnham opens - since it captures some of the most deep-seeded thoughts and feelings I've endured this year.

Sludge-Metal has been my main-stay the past few years - mostly as a productivity tool for work. Nothing like Bludgeoning Riffs to lock-in the zone and drive the engines of ruin.

From there, it's onto various hip-hop. Some of it meaningful, some of it brainless bops.

Next up is some math-y jams. All the benefits of Metal, but more dynamic.

From there things slow down a bit with some back catalogue indie / folk tracks that resonated with me for one reason or another.

I brought back a few math-y jams so the playlist doesn't end on a whimper.

And Bo Burnham closes us out with two of his new tracks that help comedy adjust to it's new home here in the pre-dystopia.

# Games:

### The Year of Disco.

I finally got to play Disco Elysium just before _The Final Cut_ content released. I'm glad I got to experience the original game in full, partially because it made the quality of life features of _The Final Cut_ that much more enjoyable.

There's plenty written about _Disco Elysium_ all over the internet. It'll be hard to say anything meaningful that hasn't already been said before by professionals.

In the spirit of showing, and not telling, here are a few moments I managed to tune my old corroded heartstrings:

[This Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXggkIIhcMM) managed to capture a very specific and nuanced pain-point that was wandering through my mind like lost fire...Which is the way a field as dynamic and interesting as technology has become plagued by myopic dullards that are more focused on the illusion of productivity, rather than innovation and progress.

Like _many_ things in _Disco_, this scene is too visceral to be written from anything other than experience. I took solace that _somehow, someone, somewhere_ made it out and were able to create something as impactful as _Disco_.

If they made it...maybe I can too. Cheers to the good life. Wherever it is, and whatever it happens to be.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eNt34OErJY) we see a 180 into something more light-hearted, but just as well executed.

I've got hundreds of screenshots, and hours of captured footage. Rest assured that _Disco_ will get it's own dedicated post..._one day..._

### The Year of the Dark Fort.

![mork](../../../assets/images/2021/morkborgyear.jpg)

I always burn out of TTRPGs. *IF* a story manages to grip me, I usually become bored, overwhelmed, or both.

This often ends with low-key frustration as I sabotage the game in an attempt to kill off my character so that I'm no longer bound to carrying on the story of _Hector Thewellen Dowd_.

Enter [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/) - A blood-soaked lust-letter to [TTRPGs](../../../assets/images/2021/MB_Heretical_Priest.jpeg), [Graphic](../../../assets/images/2021/MB_Design_02.jpeg) [Design](../../../assets/images/2021/MB_Design.jpeg) and [Copy](../../../assets/images/2021/Mork_Borg_01.jpg) & [Print](../../../assets/images/2021/Mork_Borg_02.jpg).

Characters are not long for this world. So much so - the developers have provided an online [Character Generator](https://scvmbirther.makedatanotlore.dev/) allowing your quest to churn 'em and burn 'em, No ~~Limbs~~ Strings Attached.

_MÖRK BORG_'s liberal and no-bullshit [licensing](https://morkborg.com/license/) means there's a vast ocean of custom content from an incredibly active and talented community. So much content, it might be overwhelming where to start once you've mastered the basics.

Thankfully - I have an answer for you. My kindred spirit over at [Newyear Studios](https://newyearstudios.com/) has put out some of the highest quality *and* quantity content in the community.

There's a 100% chance that anyone ~~reading~~ skimming this was sent here by me, so I won't bang my drum too much.

I'm including it because watching my best friend of 25+ years put out some of the highest quality TTRPG Content I've ever played on a professional level was a spoonful of sugar to make the heroine of 2021 go down.

I remember going through my pre-work bloodletting ritual of spiraling into miserablism...Only to make an instal 180 when I realized that _after_ my day at work, I was going to play _The Bridges of Múr_ for the first time to help test out some mechanics before the content shipped.

The thought of replaying some indescribable horror over and over to act as a crucible of gameplay testing is what made the clocks move that day. I think I left around 4AM, and it was the most fun I'd ever had playing any TableTop game.

# Comedy:

I'm not sure if my mental illness ever made me brave, or strong, or anything like that. But it's at least always made me funny. What else can you do with a brain that's as sanitary as a Truck Stop Buffet at 8:30PM.
