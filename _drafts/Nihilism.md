# I've got nothing to hide.

I usually see this argument as a mental defense mechanism than an earnest conversation point. It's completely understandable when the brain is confronted by the _yawning maw of unrelenting thoughts_ that are so abundant these days. Even I tried to dismiss the snowden leaks when I first learned of them. If someone's lucky enough to truly believe they have nothing to hide - nothing I can say will change their mind. Sounds like bliss. Live it.

But - for me, there's no virtue in _not_ knowing.

Can you imagine a person _so boring_ they have nothing to hide? It doesn't take long to realize the people saying this also have locks on their doors, curtains on their windows. They probably close the door when they go to the bathroom, and might even be _vile_ enough to enjoy sex outside of the sole purpose of procreation. None of the above are _wrong._ But there's a reasonable right to privacy involved.

Some people enjoy a life where they can knowingly and safely exchange metadata for the dopamine rush of a 10% off coupon.

It's not like metadata has ever gotten anyone killed.

History doesn't _repeat_ itself, but it fuckin' rhymes.
