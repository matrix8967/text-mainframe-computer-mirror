# Getting Here

This build is a drastic change from it's predecessor in almost every way - and represents a sharp correction back to the core values I hold regarding Engineering and Design.

It's a purpose built design towards CPU and GPU performance. These have always been priorities, but there were usually distractions or concessions.

# Ship of Theseus

Something that made this much easier was replacing components individually over time, rather than all at once. Starting in 2019, I'd started to rethink my initial design of my 2017 build. I'll go over the details more when I rebuild and document my 2017 machine - but the `tldr` is that I experimented with quite a few new methods (at the same time), in the way I designed my systems. Some of these changes worked out surprisingly well - some of them did not.

Slowly building towards the future one component group at a time allowed me to focus on each component individually and research the best parts that fit some of my needs.

See this for some caveats when considering this approach.\*

#### A quick note to beginners on this:

This can be _significantly_ more difficult when getting started, because your first build(s) require a complete ground-up investment. When you're starting your 2nd build, you can upcycle MANY components: Cases, Drives, Fans, Power Supplies, and Cables can all be easily upgraded for much longer than the life span of other components. (I still have many of these components from some of my first builds.) These are a monument to future-tolerant designs and are a measurable victory for open-standards.

Even your 2nd and 3rd builds may not be as easy for this "one piece at a time" mindset if you find yourself needing to replace those parts that _can_ migrate, but for performance or compatability reasons may not directly translate. While you MAYBE able to lean on friends or family or local building groups to resell some of these parts to offset the cost of new equipment - also understand there's a very limited market for your year(s) old, constantly used powersupply
