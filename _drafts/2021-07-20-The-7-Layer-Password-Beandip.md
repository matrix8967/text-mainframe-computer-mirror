# A common enemy in dividing times...

What do modern cryptologists, cybersecurity engineers, `1337h4x0rz`, Edward Snowden, the NSA, your technology-challenged-relative(s) and _you_ all have in common?

Everybody ~~Loves~~ Loathes Passwords.

Passwords aren't even _the best of the worst_; They're just the middle-children of the security world...

So - in an age where the wealth of human knowledge is just a few pecks away on our space-aged sattelite glass...

Why the fuck are we still using this _Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_ horseshit to guard our ~~tasteful n00dz~~ digital lives?

It's a mixed-bag of Psychology, Computer Science, and the _Original Sin_ of some of computer science...

# How password shenanigans works:

- Someone signs up for a service.
- They create a `username` and `password`.
- They sign up for 250 more services over the next few years.
- The use the same `username` and `password` because it's easy-peazy to remember.
- One of these 250+ services _inevitably_ gets compromised.
- Now attacker(s) have access to the original account _+249_ extras.

This is why you're always brow-beaten by IT Departments to create a _unique_ password for each service you use while also memorizing it or storing it securely...

# Why passwords suck bucky balls:

Creating a *good* password is a real pickle.

A good password is frustrating for most normies to keep up with for day-to-day work; not to mention the need for a unique *and* good password for each login.

## Dealing with Passwords.

### DO:

- Think of a passphrase, instead of a password. A favorite quote from a book, movie, or game is good start.
	- **Example:**: "_The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't._"
- Use words that would not appear next to each other in a dictionary. (1Password can generate these for you.)
	- **Example:**: *modesty-variant-malice-carven*
- Use complex and interesting characters. (Brackets, Backticks, Pipes, ASCII, Unicode, and Emojis.)
	- **Example:**:

### DON'T:

- Use a password you've ever used before. New Year; New You!

- Use any dates of any format.

- Use names of any kind.

# tl;dr at the top:

	* Don't use a _password_ use a _passphrase:_
	* Three words that won't appear together in plain english.
	* Some really shitty poetry you wrote.
	* Emojis (But this can kind of suck if you're signing into an older site.)
	* A favorite line from a Movie, Play, Book, Song is good...But...
		* Yet another reason to keep that shit about `A Shore Thing` by `Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi` being _your scripture_ to yourself.
