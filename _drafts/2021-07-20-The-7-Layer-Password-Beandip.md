# A common enemy in dividing times...

What do modern cryptologists, cybersecurity engineers, `1337h4x0rz`, Edward Snowden, the NSA, your technology-challenged-relative(s) and _you_ have in common?

Everybody ~~Loves~~ Loathes Passwords.

Passwords aren't even _the best of the worst_; They're really just the middle-children of the security world...

So - in an age where the wealth of human knowledge is at our fingertips, just a few pecks away on our space-aged sattelite glass...

Why the fuck are we still using this _Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_ horseshit to guard our ~~tasteful n00dz~~ digital lives?

It's a mixed-bag of Psychology, Computer Science, and the _Original Sin_ of some of technologies founding Mothers & Fathers.

# tl;dr at the top:

	* Don't use a _password_ use a _passphrase:_
	* Three words that won't appear together in plain english.
	* Some really shitty poetry you wrote.
	* Emojis (But this can kind of suck if you're signing into an older site.)
	* A favorite line from a Movie, Play, Book, Song is good...But...
		* Yet another reason to keep that shit about `A Shore Thing` by `Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi` being _your scripture_ to yourself.
