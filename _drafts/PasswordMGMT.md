# Password Manament:

What does a good password look like? The best passwords make it look like a cat took an hour nap on your keyboard. For example:`zy>iHt-OXkc[mTk]OX/V_P:O=b2^Z]L]` is a great password. But it's next to impossible to remember. Even if you could remember it, if it ever became compromised, then it would have to be considered public knowledge. So what's the point in memorizing passwords?

There's not one. Memorizing Passwords is a flawed way to access an account for quite a few reasons:

-   Computers can guess any combination of dictionary words in a matter of seconds, no matter how clever you belive you're mutating them.

-   The responsibility to create unique and complex passwords falls upon users.

-   To help with memorization, many users will write down their password in what they imagine is a safe place. "Security by Obscurity" is not really anykind of security at all.
