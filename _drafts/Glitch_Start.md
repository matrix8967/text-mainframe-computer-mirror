# What's in a name?

If ever there was a machine that lived up to it's namesake - It's Glitch.

I'll do my best to not be TOO critical of this build - since many of the foundational choices carried through to the final product. But this was a massive departure from my usual design focuses. Sadly, this is also a monument to where I was in my life when building this machine.

Wayward. Lost. Yearning for new. Frustrated and critical. Focused on all the wrong things. But still, through it all - performant even in my most backwards design goals.
