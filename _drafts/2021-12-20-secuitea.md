# Mozilla Firefox

We'll be leaning _HEAVILY_ into the Mozilla Firefox Ecosystem here for simplicities sake.

Mozilla (the non-profit that builds Firefox) offers *A LOT* of basic services for free with their account service. They also provide a *ton* a excellent documentation and knowledge all for the public good and the health of the Internet.

* [Mozilla Security Tips](https://monitor.firefox.com/security-tips)

## Firefox Relay

`Firefox Relay` allows you to create "burner" email addresses that forward to a final destination address. This way *WHEN* your credentials are exposed in a data breach, the information is useless. The password you created in your Password Manager is easily replaced, and now the *other* half of that equation is just as disposable. This way your email address doesn't get bombed with spam, or the years of phishing attempts that will come after your email shows up in credential dumps. 

* [Their site has more details.](https://relay.firefox.com/)

## Firefox Multi-Account Containers

Multi-Account Containers allow you to Isolate and Jail off individual browser tabs from one another. This will stop advertisers and trackers from following you around the internet.

You can set up filters so that certain sites *only* open up in isolated tabs.

This also has benefits for Developers and other Tech-Savvy users who may need to be logged into multiple accounts at the same time.

# Brave

[Brave](https://brave.com/) is an alternative to Google Chrome that's built on the same technology. It focuses on being more secure and privacy friendly, while still allowing you to be integrated into the Google Chrome ecosystem.

It has other interesting features, like allowing _vetted and approved_ advertisements in exchange for Crypto - But I'll be honest, I've never really used it.

Any chrome extension should translate over to working in Brave without issue.

## Chrome Extensions:

* [Bitwarden.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bitwarden-free-password-m/nngceckbapebfimnlniiiahkandclblb)

# Browser Agnostic Enhancements:

## Your passwords are terrible. Stop using them.

It's not your fault. Passwords are computing's _Original Sin._

It's an authentication mechanism as old as written history. Whoever said "Open Sesame!" never could have imagined _The Internet_.

Now _EVERY_ door must be opened with a different incantation.

If you choose to lock all your doors with "OpenSesame123" - you may as well just consider anything behind those doors public information.

So...what's the solution? Setup a Password Manager.

I use Bitwarden, but there are others like 1Password, KeepassXC, and Mozilla's Lockwise.

No matter which Password Manager you choose, the idea is the same:

* Download the App(s) and Browser Extensions for your Password Manager.
* Login using a _new_ and _secure_ password. If done correctly, this should be the last password you'll ever need. Make it a good one.
* Once you're logged in, your Password Manager will generate _random_ and _secure_ password for *ALL* your services, as well as remember them and handle logging in for you.

Ignorance is bliss.

If you want to check if an email address or password has been compromised, you can check using [this website](https://haveibeenpwned.com/). Note that once your password manager is setup, it will handle this for you.

## Ad Blocker(s)

Using a good AdBlocker is a near-effortless step in increasing your overall _digital diet_. If we think so much about what we put in our bodies, we should also think about what we put in our brains and where it comes from. I'm a fan of the "Farm-to-Table" digital experience.

`uBlock Origin` is a great AdBlocker for your browser, and has a ton of features. Using it's `eyedropper` tool to get around websites fullscreen element paywalls is one use. You can add custom filters for blocking other annoying things on the web.

## Searching

Lastly, changing your default search engine from `Google` over to `DuckDuckGo` is another great step towards increasing privacy *AANNDD* productivity. I get *vastly* superior search results from `DDG` than I do from `Google` _especially_ for technical searches in our field of work. If you can't find what you're looking for in the first search result, you simply add `!g` to your search, and `DDG` will proxy your search to Google. They do this with _hundreds_ of other sites as well. `!w` will search Wikipedia, etc.

They also use a browser extension that helps you search, but also rates websites based on the sites privacy standards. I'll include it at the bottom with a list of other web extensions I use.
