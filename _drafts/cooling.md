### _WHOOSH_

The CPU Cooler consists of a [large metal heatsink](../../../assets/images/RWB/finland.jpg) with two fans configured in a "push/pull" arrangement. The heatsink is ðŸ‘Œ [*firmly*](../../../assets/images/RWB/screwd.jpeg) attached to the CPU by tension mounting.

A layer of [thermal paste](../../../assets/images/RWB/compounding.jpg) conducts heat away from the die of the CPU, and uses the 6 large heat pipes to distribute the heat throughout surface area of the layered fins.

[Cool air is pulled from the front,](../../../assets/images/RWB/whoosh.png) through the fins of the heatsink, where it's exhausted out of the back.

The name of the game is to move heat *away* from the CPU and get it out of the case. For the first time every fan in the entire system is working on a "Fan Curve" which is to say each fan (even PSU, GPU Fans) speed is dependent on temperature. Idle temps mean the case and CPU fans lumber alone at leisurely `>400rpm` rate, while GPU and PSU fans don't engage at all.

Maybe confidence is a little _too_ quiet here, as I've actually had a hard time sleeping without the steady hum of case fans to occupy my lizard brain...
